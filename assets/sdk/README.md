## Getting started

Widget is a component that is embedded in application; refer to examples below.

1. Include needed web-component.
2. Setup `props` for a form.
- Important: `props` must be setup prior to JS script inclusion.
3. Include data in form.
4. Include needed JS script directly (or via npm).
- You can download npm from:
```
npm i @unlimint/client-js-sdk
```
- Import one of the 3 available widgets form in code of your project:
```
import '@unlimint/client-js-sdk/unlimint-card-form.js'
import '@unlimint/client-js-sdk/unlimint-pay-form.js'
import '@unlimint/client-js-sdk/unlimint-pay-token-form.js' 
```

The default styling in JS SDK is made via **Inter** font. If you do not plan applying customizations with another font, then you have to include **Inter** separately:

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;600&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

If your application contains **TypeScript** you can include **js-sdk.d.ts** annotations file to enable types checking into widget creation process.

TypeScript compiler includes these annotations into widget's data.

---

Widgets require URL addresses to receive requests. URLs must be pointed in `props` -> `urls` property.

The supported URLs:

- `generateMobileToken` - endpoint for mobile token generation, used in widget for authorization
- `cardBinding` - endpoint for card binding
- `payment` - endpoint for payment transaction

Mobile token endpoint addresses:

- demo https://sandbox.cardpay.com/demo-merchant/mobile/generate_token
- sandbox environment https://sandbox.cardpay.com/api/mobile/token
- production environment https://cardpay.com/api/mobile/token

Processing endpoint addresses:

- sandbox card binding request https://sandbox.cardpay.com/api/mobile/cardbinding
- sandbox card payment request https://sandbox.cardpay.com/api/mobile/payment
- production card binding request https://cardpay.com/api/mobile/cardbinding
- production card payment request https://cardpay.com/api/mobile/payment

---

Widgets allow to setup `enableRedirect` property having `true`/`false` value; false by default:

- `true` - after widget's form submitting user is redirected on the next step of flow via URL provided by processing backend, but `callbacks` -> `resolve` property will be ignored

---

### CardForm widget

CardForm widget contains a form for bank card binding feature.

The form allows customer to fill in card's data and save (bind) it for further payments in order to make the purchasing process quick and simple.

## Callbacks

Widgets allow to react on result of initiated operation via `props` -> `callbacks` property; it is a key-value object; key - defines event name, value - defines processor-function.

At the moment only callback `resolve` is supported. It is initiated after operation complete.

Callback is an object of the following type:
```javascript
{ status: 200, data: { /* data from backend API */ } }
```

## Customization

Widgets support UI customization for lables, styles. Customization parameters are applied to widget's instance upon creation via `props`.

Widgets consist of components set that includes elements. CSS-class or style-object can be assigned to an element in order to override the default one.

Name of widget's component starts with prefix `$`; name of element has no prefix.

Elements can have a set of states: field focus, input validation notice etc.

State naming template is `${elementName}_${stateName}`.

State customization must be performed via `customClasses` property only.
